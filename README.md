Co-chair committee auditable anonymous forums. ðŸ¦¤

## Overview

`what-does-dodo-say` is a simple forum which based on asymmetric cryptography and secret sharing.

It aims to build a fair, open, and anonymous forum.

The forum is "auditable" which means there is still a way (and it's the only way) to reveal the anonymous identities of the forum members.

Before it really "reveals the anonymous identities of the forum members", it must be approved by at least `N` of all the `M` co-chair committee members.

> `M` and `N` means it's configurable. Actually, it's one of the concepts in secret sharing.

As we could elect the trusted and co-chair committee members, and keep them rotating, the forum would keep going on with fair, open, and anonymous.
